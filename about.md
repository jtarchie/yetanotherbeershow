# About Yet Another Beer Show

For a quick crash course in what we’re about, give this short video a look:

### **We choose the beer and get to drink it, too!**

In the long tradition of online beer reviewing podcasts, the world has yet
another choice. Started early in 2010 by two beer enthusiasts from San
Francisco, Yet Another Beer Show is a semi-regular video podcast where you’ll
find, more often than not, two dudes reviewing one beer. Since the beginning,
we’ve strived to find interesting, yet accessible beers for folks to go out and
find and try on their own.

### **Meet the Original YABBERS, JT and Colin**

whole thing started when JT asked Colin if he’d be interested in reviewing a few
beers… on camera… and the Internet. Colin’s a bit of a whore for attention, so
starting a web show isn’t a hard sell for him. So, thus, the two started
reviewing some of their favorite beers, recording the debacle, and posting the
results online and Yet Another Beer Show was born.

If you’re curious to check out some of their early exploits, here’s a list of
some choice early episodes:

After a series of great episodes, tragedy was looming as Colin had plans to move
back to his east coast homeland with his fiance. With their collective passion
for rating good brews, however, JT and Colin decided to turn the show into a
long distance relationship.

And hence….

### **They Split Coasts and Brought in Some New Dudes!**

In order to make the show work, JT and Colin both tapped some of their closest
friends in order to each produce their own version of Yet Another Beer Show,
creating East and West editions of the show.

original **San Francisco** show features JT and his partner-in-crime, Steve, who
brings an enthusiasm for beer and even home based brewing to his reviews.
Together, Steve and JT explore some of the best craft and specialty beers
available to them in and around the Bay Area. Steve also led the show for the
first of
[our home brewing features](http://yetanotherbeershow.com/topics/home-brewing),
creating his own recipe Porter.

on the east coast, based out of sunny **Philadelphia**, Chris and Kasey help
Colin review beers from up and down the eastern seaboard. Well, neither show
necessarily stays within any boundaries, but the focus is always on trying to
pinpoint delicious, interesting beers that you can actually go out and find on
your own.
